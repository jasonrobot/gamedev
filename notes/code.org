Map Problems:
Since I'm not using gamera, and hump.camera doesnt have a nice way to get the viewport, I'm going to have to do some kind of manual culling.
The plan originally was to have several fairly large chunks of map that could be loaded on the fly and only drawn when needed. It would be something like:
 -----------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---+---+---|
| 4 | P | 6 |
|---+---+---|
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
 -----------
